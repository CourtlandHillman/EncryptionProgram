# EncryptionProgram
The Java Encryption Program is a versatile and essential tool designed to enhance data security by 
converting plain text into ciphertext through encryption algorithms. Developed in Java, 
this program empowers users to protect sensitive information, messages, or files from unauthorized access, 
ensuring confidentiality and data integrity.

Key Features:

Encryption Algorithms: The program supports various encryption algorithms such as AES, RSA, and DES, 
allowing users to choose the level of security and encryption strength that suits their specific needs.

User-Friendly Interface: With an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java Swing, 
users can easily input their text or select files for encryption, making the process straightforward and accessible.

File Encryption: Beyond text, the program enables users to encrypt files, enhancing privacy and security for documents,
images, or any digital assets. Decryption options are also provided for safe retrieval.

Password Protection: Users can add an extra layer of security by setting a password for encrypted files or text, 
ensuring that only those with the correct credentials can access the data.

Random Key Generation: For certain encryption algorithms, the program generates random cryptographic keys, 
further enhancing security.

Decryption Capability: The program allows users to decrypt ciphertext back into plain text or original files, 
making it a comprehensive encryption and decryption solution.

Project Goals:

Strengthen data security and confidentiality through encryption.
Promote an understanding of encryption techniques and algorithms.
Provide a user-friendly tool for encrypting text and files.
